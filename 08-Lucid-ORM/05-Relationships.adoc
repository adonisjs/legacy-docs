= Relationships

toc::[]

*Relationships* are the backbone of data-driven applications, linking one model type to another.

For example, a `User` could have many `Post` relations, and each `Post` could have many `Comment` relations.

Lucid's expressive API makes the process of associating and fetching model relations simple and intuitive, without the need to touch a SQL statement or even edit a SQL schema.

== Basic Example
Letâ€™s examine a scenario containing two models: `User` and `Profile`.

In our example, every `User` instance can have *a single* `Profile`.

We call this a *one to one* relationship.

=== Defining Relationship
To define this relationship, add the following method to your `User` model:

.app/Models/User.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Models/Profile')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

In the example above, we added a `profile` method to the `User` model returning a `hasOne` relationship typed to the `Profile` model.

If the `Profile` model does not exist, generate it:

[source, bash]
----
> adonis make:model Profile
----

.app/Models/Profile.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class Profile extends Model {
}

module.exports = Profile
----

NOTE: There is no need to define a relationship on both the models. Setting it one-way on a single model is all that's required.

=== Fetching User Profile
Now we've defined the relationship between `User` and `Profile`, we can execute the following code to fetch a user's profile:

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)
const userProfile = await user.profile().fetch()
----

== Has One
A `hasOne` relation defines a *one to one* relationship using a *foreign key* to the related model.

=== API
[source, js]
----
hasOne(relatedModel, primaryKey, foreignKey)
----

relatedModel::
An IoC container reference to the model the current model *has one of*.

primaryKey::
Defaults to the current model primary key (i.e. `id`).

foreignKey::
Defaults to `tableName_primaryKey` of the current model. The singular form of the table name is used (for example, the foreign key `user_id` references the `id` column on the table `users`).

=== Database Tables

=== Defining Relation
.app/Models/User.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Models/Profile')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----


== Has Many
A `hasMany` relation defines a *one to many* relationship using a *foreign key* to the other related models.

=== API
[source, js]
----
hasMany(relatedModel, primaryKey, foreignKey)
----

relatedModel::
An IoC container reference to the model the current model *has many of*.

primaryKey::
Defaults to the current model primary key (i.e. `id`).

foreignKey::
Defaults to `tableName_primaryKey` of the current model. The singular form of the table name is used (for example, the foreign key `user_id` references the `id` column on the table `users`).

=== Database Tables
link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502900449/HasMany_kkbac9.png[image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502900449/HasMany_kkbac9.png[], window="_blank"]

=== Defining Relation
.app/Models/User.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  posts () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Models/Post')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

== Belongs To
The `belongsTo` relationship is the inverse of the xref:_has_one[hasOne] relationship and is applied on the other end of the relation.

Continuing with our `User` and `Profile` example, the `Profile` model belongs to the `User` model, and thus has the `belongsTo` relationship defined on it.

=== API
[source, js]
----
belongsTo(relatedModel, primaryKey, foreignKey)
----

relatedModel::
An IoC container reference to the model the current model *belongs to*.

primaryKey::
Defaults to the related model foreign key (in our `Profile` belongs to `User` example, this would be `user_id`).

foreignKey::
Defaults to the related model primary key.

=== Database Tables
link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502900684/BelongsTo_fwqdc3.png[image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502900684/BelongsTo_fwqdc3.png[], window="_blank"]

=== Defining Relation
.app/Models/Profile.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class Profile extends Model {
  user () {
    return this.belongsTo('App/Models/User')
  }
}

module.exports = Profile
----

== Belongs To Many
The `belongsToMany` relationship allows you to define *many to many* relationships on both the models.

For example:

[ol-shrinked]
1. A `User` can have many `Car` models.
2. A `Car` can have many `User` models (i.e. owners) during its lifespan.

As both `User` and `Car` can have many relations of the other model, we say that each model *belongs to many* of the other model.

When defining a `belongsToMany` relationship, we don't store a foreign key on either of our model tables as we did for `hasOne` and `hasMany` relationships.

Instead, we must rely on a third, intermediary table called a *pivot table*.

NOTE: You can create pivot tables using link:migrations[migration files].

=== API
[source, js]
----
belongsToMany(
  relatedModel,
  foreignKey,
  relatedForeignKey,
  primaryKey,
  relatedPrimaryKey
)
----

relatedModel::
An IoC container reference to the model the current model *has many of*.

foreignKey::
Defaults to the current model foreign key (in our `User` belongs to many `Car` example, this would be `user_id`).

relatedForeignKey::
Defaults to the related model foreign key (in our `User` belongs to many `Car` example, this would be `car_id`).

primaryKey::
Defaults to the current model primary key (i.e. `id`).

relatedPrimaryKey::
Defaults to the related model primary key (i.e. `id`).

=== Database Tables

link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502903344/BelongsToMany_ngg7oj.png[image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502903344/BelongsToMany_ngg7oj.png[], window="_blank"]

=== Defining Relation
.app/Models/Car.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  cars () {
    return this.belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

In the example above, the table named `car_user` is the *pivot table* storing the unique relationship between `Car` and `User` model primary keys.

==== pivotTable
By default, pivot table names are derived by sorting *lowercased* related model names in *alphabetical order* and joining them with a `_` character (e.g. `User` + `Car` = `car_user`).

To set a custom pivot table name, call `pivotTable` in the relationship definition:

[source, js]
----
cars () {
  return this
    .belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
    .pivotTable('user_cars')
}
----

==== withTimestamps
By default, pivot tables aren't assumed to have timestamps.

To enable timestamps, call `withTimestamps` in the relationship definition:

[source, js]
----
cars () {
  return this
    .belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
    .withTimestamps()
}
----

==== withPivot
By default, only foreign keys are returned from a pivot table.

To return other pivot table fields, call `withPivot` in the relationship definition:

[source, js]
----
cars () {
  return this
    .belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
    .withPivot(['is_current_owner'])
}
----

==== pivotModel
For more control over queries made to a pivot table, you can bind a *pivot model*:

[source, js]
----
cars () {
  return this
    .belongsToMany('App/Models/Car')
    .pivotModel('App/Models/UserCar')
}
----

.app/Models/UserCar.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class UserCar extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()
    this.addHook('beforeCreate', (userCar) => {
      userCar.is_current_owner = true
    })
  }
}

module.exports = UserCar
----

In the example above, `UserCar` is a regular Lucid model.

With a pivot model assigned, you can use lifecycle link:database-hooks[hooks], link:database-getters-setters[getters/setters], etc.

NOTE: After calling `pivotModel` you cannot call the `pivotTable` and `withTimestamps` methods. Instead, you are required to set those values on the pivot model itself.

== Many Through
The `manyThrough` relationship is a convenient way to define an *indirect* relation.

For example:

[ol-shrinked]
1. A `User` belongs to a `Country`.
2. A `User` has many `Post` models.

Using `manyThrough`, you can fetch all `Post` models for a given `Country`.

=== API
[source, js]
----
manyThrough(
  relatedModel,
  relatedMethod,
  primaryKey,
  foreignKey
)
----

relatedModel::
An IoC container reference to the model the current model *needs access through* to reach the indirectly related model.

relatedMethod::
The relationship method called on `relatedModel` to fetch the indirectly related model results through.

primaryKey::
Defaults to the current model primary key (i.e. `id`).

foreignKey::
Defaults to the foreign key for the current model (in our `Posts` through `Country` example, this would be `country_id`).

=== Database Tables
link:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502905066/HasManyThrough_dcr86k.png[image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/q_100/v1502905066/HasManyThrough_dcr86k.png[], window="_blank"]

=== Defining Relations
The relationships need defining on both primary and intermediary models.

Continuing with our `Posts` through `Country` example, let's define the required `hasMany` relationship on the intermediary `User` model:

.app/Models/User.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  posts () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Models/Post')
  }
}
----

Finally, define the `manyThrough` relationship on the primary `Country` model:

.app/Models/Country.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class Country extends Model {
  posts () {
    return this.manyThrough('App/Models/User', 'posts')
  }
}
----

In the example above, the second parameter is a reference to the `posts` method on the `User` model. 

NOTE: The `relatedMethod` parameter must always be passed to the `manyThrough` method for a *many through* relationship to work.

== Querying Data
Querying related data is greatly simplified by Lucid's intuitive API, providing a consistent interface for all types of model relationships.

If a `User` has many `Post` models, we can fetch all posts for user `id=1` like so:

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)
const posts = await user.posts().fetch()
----

Add runtime constraints by calling link:lucid#_query_builder[Query Builder] methods like a typical query:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

// published posts
const posts = await user
  .posts()
  .where('is_published', true)
  .fetch()
----

The above example fetches all published posts for user `id=1`.

=== Querying Pivot Table
You can add `where` clauses for `belongsToMany` pivot tables like so:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

const cars = await user
  .cars()
  .wherePivot('is_current_owner', true)
  .fetch()
----

The above example fetches all cars where their current owner is user `id=1`.

The methods `whereInPivot` and `orWherePivot` are also available.

== Eager Loading
When you want to fetch relations for more than one base relation (e.g. posts for more than one user), *eager loading* is the preferred way to do so.

*Eager loading* is the concept of fetching relationships with the minimum database queries possible in an attempt to avoid the link:https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabcontrib/article/n_plus_one/#overview[`n+1` problem, window="_blank"].

*Without eager loading*, using the techniques discussed previously in this section:

.Not Recommended
[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const users = await User.all()
const posts = []

for (let user of users) {
  const userPosts = await user.posts().fetch()
  posts.push(userPosts)
}
----

The above example makes `n+1` queries to the database, where `n` is the number of users. Looping through a large number of users would result in a large sequence of queries made to the database, which is hardly ideal!

*With eager loading*, only 2 queries are required to fetch all users and their posts:

.Recommended
[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts')
  .fetch()
----

The `with` method eager loads the passed relation as part of the original payload, so running `users.toJSON()` will now return an output like so:

.JSON Output
[source, js]
----
[
  {
    id: 1,
    username: 'virk',
    posts: [{
      id: 1,
      user_id: 1,
      title: '...'
    }]
  }
]
----

In the JSON output above, each `User` object now has a `posts` relationship property, making it easy to spot at a glance which `Post` belongs to which `User`.

=== Adding Runtime Constraints
Add runtime constraints to eager loaded relationships like so:

[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_published', true)
  })
  .fetch()
----

=== Loading Multiple Relations
Multiple relations can be loaded by chaining the `with` method:

[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts')
  .with('profile')
  .fetch()
----

=== Loading Nested Relations
Nested relations are loaded via *dot notation*.

The following query loads all `User` posts and their related comments:

[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts.comments')
  .fetch()
----

Nested relation constraint callbacks apply only to the *last relation*:

[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts.comments', (builder) => {
    builder.where('approved', true)
  })
  .fetch()
----

In the example above, the `builder.where` clause is only applied to the `comments` relationship (not the `posts` relationship).

To add a constraint to the *first relation*, use the following approach:
[source, js]
----
const users = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_published', true)
      .with('comments')
  })
  .fetch()
----

In the example above, a `where` constraint is added to the `posts` relation while eager loading `posts.comments` at the same time.

=== Retrieving loaded models data
To retrieve the loaded data you must call the `getRelated` method:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User
  .query()
  .with('posts')
  .fetch()

const posts = user.getRelated('posts')
----

== Lazy Eager Loading
To load relationships *after* already fetching data, use the `load` method.

For example, to load related `posts` after already fetching a `User`:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.load('posts')
----

You can lazily load multiple relationships using the `loadMany` method:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.loadMany(['posts', 'profiles'])
----

To set query constraints via `loadMany` you must pass an object:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.loadMany({
  posts: (builder) => builder.where('is_published', true),
  profiles: null
})
----

=== Retrieving loaded models data
To retrieve the loaded data you must call the `getRelated` method:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.loadMany(['posts', 'profiles'])

const posts = user.getRelated('posts')
const profiles = user.getRelated('profiles')
----

== Filtering Data
Lucid's API makes it simple to filter data depending on a relationship's existence.

Let's use the classic example of finding all *posts with comments*.

Here's our `Post` model and its `comments` relationship definition:

.app/Models/Post.js
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class Post extends Model {
  comments () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Models/Comments')
  }
}
----

==== has
To only retrieve posts with at least one `Comment`, chain the `has` method:

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .has('comments')
  .fetch()
----

*It's that simple!*&nbsp;ðŸ˜²

Add an expression/value constraint to the `has` method like so:

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .has('comments', '>', 2)
  .fetch()
----

The above example will only retrieve posts with more than 2 comments.

==== whereHas
The `whereHas` method is similar to `has` but enables more specific constraints.

For example, to fetch all posts with at least 2 published comments:

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .whereHas('comments', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_published', true)
  }, '>', 2)
  .fetch()
----

==== doesntHave
The opposite of the `has` clause:

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .doesntHave('comments')
  .fetch()
----

NOTE: This method does not accept an expression/value constraint.

==== whereDoesntHave
The opposite of the `whereHas` clause:

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .whereDoesntHave('comments', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_published', false)
  })
  .fetch()
----

NOTE: This method does not accept an expression/value constraint.

You can add an `or` clause by calling the `orHas`, `orWhereHas`, `orDoesntHave` and `orWhereDoesntHave` methods.

== Counts
Retrieve relationship *counts* by calling the `withCount` method:

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .withCount('comments')
  .fetch()

posts.toJSON()
----

.JSON Output
[source, js]
----
{
  title: 'Adonis 101',
  __meta__: {
    comments_count: 2
  }
}
----

Define an *alias* for a count like so:

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .withCount('comments as total_comments')
  .fetch()
----

.JSON Output
[source, js]
----
__meta__: {
  total_comments: 2
}
----

=== Count Constraints
For example, to only retrieve the count of comments which have been approved:

[source, js]
----
const posts = await Post
  .query()
  .withCount('comments', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_approved', true)
  })
  .fetch()
----

== Inserts, Updates & Deletes
Adding, updating and deleting related records is as simple as querying data.

==== save
The `save` method expects an instance of the related model.

`save` can be applied to the following relationship types:

[ul-shrinked]
- `hasOne`
- `hasMany`
- `belongsToMany`

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const Post = use('App/Models/Post')

const user = await User.find(1)

const post = new Post()
post.title = 'Adonis 101'

await user.posts().save(post)
----

==== create
The `create` method is similar to `save` but expects a plain JavaScript object, returning the related model instance.

`create` can be applied to the following relationship types:

[ul-shrinked]
- `hasOne`
- `hasMany`
- `belongsToMany`

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)

const post = await user
  .posts()
  .create({ title: 'Adonis 101' })
----

==== createMany
Save many related rows to the database.

`createMany` can be applied to the following relationship types:

[ul-shrinked]
- `hasMany`
- `belongsToMany`

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)

const post = await user
  .posts()
  .createMany([
    { title: 'Adonis 101' },
    { title: 'Lucid 101' }
  ])
----

==== saveMany
Similar to `save`, but instead saves multiple instances of the related model:

`saveMany` can be applied to the following relationship types:

[ul-shrinked]
- `hasMany`
- `belongsToMany`

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const Post = use('App/Models/Post')

const user = await User.find(1)

const adonisPost = new Post()
adonisPost.title = 'Adonis 101'

const lucidPost = new Post()
lucidPost.title = 'Lucid 101'

await user
  .posts()
  .saveMany([adonisPost, lucidPost])
----

==== associate
The `associate` method is exclusive to the `belongsTo` relationship, associating two model instances with each other.

Assuming a `Profile` belongs to a `User`, to associate a `User` with a `Profile`:
[source, js]
----
const Profile = use('App/Models/Profile')
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = await User.find(1)
const profile = await Profile.find(1)

await profile.user().associate(user)
----

==== dissociate
The `dissociate` method is the opposite of `associate`.

To drop an associated relationship:

[source, js]
----
const Profile = use('App/Models/Profile')
const profile = await Profile.find(1)

await profile.user().dissociate()
----

==== attach
The `attach` method is called on a `belongsToMany` relationship to attach a related model via pivot table:

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const Car = use('App/Models/Car')

const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')
const user = await User.find(1)

await user.cars().attach([mercedes.id])
----

The `attach` method accepts an optional callback receiving the `pivotModel` instance, allowing you to set extra properties on a pivot table if required:

[source, js]
----
const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')
const audi = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '99001020')

const user = await User.find(1)
const cars = [mercedes.id, audi.id]

await user.cars().attach(cars, (row) => {
  if (row.car_id === mercedes.id) {
    row.is_current_owner = true
  }
})
----

NOTE: The `create` and `save` methods for `belongsToMany` relationships also accept a callback allowing you to set extra properties on a pivot table if required.

==== detach
The `detach` method is the opposite of the `attach` method, removing all existing pivot table relationships:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
await user.cars().detach()
----

To detach only selected relations, pass an array of ids:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')

await user.cars().detach([mercedes.id])
----

==== sync
The `sync` method provides a convenient shortcut for `detach` then `attach`:

[source, js]
----
const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')
const user = await User.find(1)

// Behave the same way as:
// await user.cars().detach()
// await user.cars().attach([mercedes.id])

await user.cars().sync([mercedes.id])
----

The `sync` method accepts an optional callback receiving the `pivotModel` instance, allowing you to set extra properties on a pivot table if required (just as you can do with `attach`):

[source, js]
----
const mercedes = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '39020103')
const audi = await Car.findBy('reg_no', '99001020')

const user = await User.find(1)
const cars = [mercedes.id, audi.id]

await user.cars().sync(cars, (row) => {
  if (row.car_id === mercedes.id) {
    row.is_current_owner = true
  }
})
----

==== update
The `update` method bulk updates queried rows.

You can use link:lucid#_query_builder[Query Builder] methods to update specific fields only:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

await user
  .posts()
  .where('title', 'Adonis 101')
  .update({ is_published: true })
----

To update a pivot table, call `pivotQuery` before `update`:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

await user
  .cars()
  .pivotQuery()
  .where('name', 'mercedes')
  .update({ is_current_owner: true })
----

==== delete
The `delete` method removes related rows from the database:

[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)

await user
  .cars()
  .where('name', 'mercedes')
  .delete()
----

NOTE: In the case of `belongsToMany`, this method also drops the relationship from the pivot table.
